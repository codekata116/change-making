Practice
========
* Basic git commands
* Writing solutions
* Basic runtime analysis
* Greedy algorithm limitations

Rules
=====
Use any language. Clone this repository, work on a branch, and create a pull request to the master branch when you're ready for a code review (all this requires a basic understanding of Git). Make sure to include a .gitignore file for the language you're working on.

Solve the [Change-Making Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem): how can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations


Example
-------
Input:

* denomination = {1, 3, 4}
* money = 6

The correct output is `coins = [3, 3]`. An incorrect output is `coins = [4, 1, 1]`.

The order of the input or output does not matter.

Questions
---------
* When does the greedy algorithm fail? Why does it fail in for those cases?
* What is the runtime of the algorithm you implemented?
* Use a unit testing framework to write tests. What are good tests to write?
